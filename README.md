Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that deals with clients and sensitive personal information that they provide. Their priority is security, and they believe that it should be everyone's responsibility. With that being said, they would like to expand and modernize their operations, but in the process, they wish to implement the current and most effective software security there is. To be more specific, Artemis Financial wants to implement a file verification step on its web application to make sure that communications with their clients remain secure and private.


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

In the procedure of looking for software security vulnerabilities, I was able to dive deeper into the vulnerabilities that were listed. This allowed me to gain a deeper insight into what could be considered a real threat for Artemis Financial, and this helped me in making informed decisions when it comes to how I should deal with these threats to assure there are no security loop holes in the development process. It is extremely important to keep the code I write secure because any vulnerability I implement can potentially be used by an attacker. This can lead to a breach in the company's system, which may expose information from both the clients and the company itself. This would be considered a heavy loss to the company's reputation, and to its profits, so in order to avoid this, code must be written safely, and intelligently with practices like using up to date software and encryption. The strength of security that the software has will influence how the company performs. Weak security practices will mean that clients are much less likely to trust their information in the company's hands, and that essentially means lost profits.


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

When I first began looking over the vulnerability assessment, I found the most challenging part being scoping out false positives. This requires the developer to consider many factors such as how important a specific piece of the software is, and whether it will massively influence the way that the software runs or not. Beyond considering the use case of the software, I had to dive deep into research and figure out the pieces in the software that are publicly known to be false positives among developers. With enough insight, it was helpful to see how certain parts of the software are flagged falsely, and it gave me a better sense of what I should be looking for and expecting when it comes to hunting down vulnerabilities that would be considered a real threat to a company like Artemis Financial.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

There are multiple layers of security that will assure that a company like Artemis Financial remains secure. It is essential to put the best software security practices to use, like when it comes to looking over finished code, it is essential to do a manual review of the code to make sure there are no bugs or errors that could potentially go unnoticed otherwise. Like for instance, a variable that should be constant, but isn't. These unnoticed errors can be a big opportunity for attackers to take advantage by performing attacks like injections. Beyond the manual review, a dependency check will also be an effective layer of defense added to the software. The dependency check will allow the developer to look over all dependencies that come from all parts of the software. This gives the developer a deeper insight into what could potentially be used by attackers, and this could range from anything like outdated pieces of software that are being used in the development process.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

As I add onto the code, I am actively checking to make sure that my code is secure, and written in the best manner possible. This will effectively help prevent me from having to go back and rewrite heaps of code because I find out that something in the code is vulnerable to attacks 100 lines later. With every bit of code I implement, I am checking to see if there are any errors or bugs that I can catch, and I am also looking over the dependency check to make sure that what I write isn't adding onto the amount of dependencies that already exist. If it does add any dependencies, then it is my responsibility to make sure that the dependency is not a real threat to the security of the software. Usually so far, this has involved deep research for me to see what the overall consensus is for certain dependencies.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I find that AI can be helpful in identifying dependencies, and in explaining what the dependencies really mean, but beyond AI, Google is still an amazing tool for looking into different websites like the National Vulnerability Database which gives an extensive insight into the vulnerabilities that may show up on a vulnerability test. Aside from tools that can be used to search up information, I find that the OWASP dependency checker is a reliable tool that can list out all the dependencies that are involved in a project of a large scale, and even smaller ones. I also find encryption and decryption tools to be essential if a company or developer would like to maximize their level of security and keep information hidden from attackers.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show future employers that I am capable of maintaining the security and integrity of the software I develop. I would want to show off my implementation of making the software more secure by adding a checksum, and I would go over how my manual review of the code helped in making it become more secure. Additionally, it will be worth showing that I have the skill and knowledge to use and look through a dependency check effectively.
